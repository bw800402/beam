# Beam

Beam - _to express by means of a radiant smile_ 

Beam is a free toolkit dedicated to parsing and generating Simplified
molecular-input line-entry system - [SMILES&trade;](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplified_molecular-input_line-entry_system)
line notations. The primary focus of the library is to elegantly handle the
SMILES&trade; syntax and as fast as possible.

## Beaming

*Note: Beam is still in a development and some APIs will likely change until a release is made.*

One of the primary types in Beam is the `Graph` it provides convenience
methods for reading SMILES&trade; notation directly.

```java
Graph g = Graph.fromSmiles("CCO");
```

and for writing it back to SMILES&trade; notation.

```java
String smi = g.toSmiles();
```

Beam provides excellent round tripping, preserving exactly how the input was
specified. Disregarding inputs with redundant brackets and erroneous/repeated
ring numbers - the actually input will generally be identical to the output.

```java
// bond labels
Graph.fromSmiles("C1=CC=CC=C1").toSmiles();    // kekule      (implicit single bonds)
Graph.fromSmiles("C-1=C-C=C-C=C1").toSmiles(); // kekule      (explicit single bonds)
Graph.fromSmiles("c1ccccc1").toSmiles();       // delocalised (implicit aromatic bonds)
Graph.fromSmiles("c:1:c:c:c:c:c1").toSmiles(); // delocalised (explicit aromatic bonds)

// bracket atoms stay as bracket atoms
Graph.fromSmiles("[CH]1=[CH][CH]=[CH][CH]=[CH]1").toSmiles();
Graph.fromSmiles("[CH]1=[CH]C=C[CH]=[CH]1").toSmiles();       // mix bracket and subset atoms
```

Although preserving the representation was one of the design goals for beam it
is common to normalise output SMILES&trade;.

_Collapse_ a graph with labelled hydrogens `[CH3][CH2][OH]` to one with implicit
hydrogens `CCO`.

```java
Graph g = Graph.fromSmiles("[CH3][CH2][OH]");
Graph h = Functions.collapse(g);
h.toSmiles().equals("CCO");
```

_Expand_ a graph where the hydrogens are implicit `CCO` to one with labelled
hydrogens `[CH3][CH2][OH]`.

```java
Graph g = Graph.fromSmiles("CCO");
Graph h = Functions.expand(g);
h.toSmiles().equals("[CH3][CH2][OH]");
```

Stereo specification is persevered through rearrangements. The example below 
randomly generates arbitrary SMILES&trade; preserving correct stereo-configuration.

```java
Graph g  = Graph.fromSmiles("CCC[C@@](C)(O)[C@H](C)N");
StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder(g.toSmiles());
for (int i = 0; i < 25; i++)
    sb.append('.').append(Functions.randomise(g).toSmiles());
System.out.println(sb);
```

Bond based double-bond configuration is normal in SMILES but can be problematic.
The issue is that a single symbol may be specifying two adjacent configurations.
A proposed extension was to use atom-based double-bond configuration.

Beam will input, output and convert atom and bond-based double-bond stereo 
specification. 

```java
Graph  g   = Graph.fromSmiles("F/C=C/F");
Graph  h   = Functions.atomBasedDBStereo(g);
String smi = h.toSmiles();
smi.equals("F[C@H]=[C@@H]F");
```

```java
Graph  g   = Graph.fromSmiles("F[C@H]=[C@@H]F");
Graph  h   = Functions.bondBasedDBStereo(g);
String smi = h.toSmiles();
smi.equals("F/C=C/F");
```

Convert a graph with delocalised bonds to kekul&eacute; representation.

```java
Graph  furan        = Graph.fromSmiles("o1cccc1");
Graph  furan_kekule = furan.kekule();
String smi          = furan_kekule.toSmiles();
smi.equals("O1C=CC=C1");
```

With bond-based double-bond stereo specification there are two possible ways to
write each bond-based configuration. beam allows you to normalise the labels such
that the first symbol is always a forward slash (`/`). Some examples are shown
below.

```java
Graph   g   = Graph.fromSmiles("F\\C=C/F");
Graph   h   = Functions.normaliseDirectionalLabels(g);
String  smi = h.toSmiles();
smi.equals("F/C=C\\F");
```

```
F/C=C/C              is normalised to F/C=C/C
F\C=C\C              is normalised to F/C=C/C
F/C=C\C              is normalised to F/C=C\C
F\C=C/C              is normalised to F/C=C\C
C(\F)(/C)=C\C        is normalised to C(/F)(\C)=C/C
FC=C(F)C=C(F)\C=C\C  is normalised to FC=C(F)C=C(F)/C=C/C
```
